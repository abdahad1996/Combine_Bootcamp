//“This publisher is used mainly in non-SwiftUI apps but you might have a need for it at some point. In many ways, this publisher works like @Published properties (or rather, @Published properties work like the CurrentValueSubject publisher).

// It’s a publisher that holds on to a value (current value) and when the value changes, it is published and sent down a pipeline when there are subscribers attached to the pipeline.

// If you are going to use this with SwiftUI then there is an extra step you will have to take so the SwiftUI view is notified of changes objectWillChange.send()”

//    var subject = CurrentValueSubject<Bool,Never>(false)

// “The newValue will ALWAYS equal the current value. Unlike @Published properties, this pipeline runs AFTER the current value has been set”

// this doesn't work CurrentValueSubject value gets updated and then our pipeline is run so the value from pipeline and the CurrentValueSubject are same
