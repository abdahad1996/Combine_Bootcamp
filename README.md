# A Publisher emits a sequence of values over time.
It can represent asynchronous operations, such as network requests, notifications, or user input.
Publishers can emit values (data) or errors, and they can complete.
Subscriber:

# A Subscriber receives values emitted by a Publisher.
It consists of methods like receive(_:subscription:), receive(completion:), and receive(subscription:).
A Subscriber can cancel its subscription using a Cancellable.
Subscription:

# The link between a Publisher and a Subscriber is represented by a Subscription.
A Subscription allows a Subscriber to control its demand for values and to cancel the subscription when no longer needed.
Cancellable:

# A Cancellable is an object that represents the act of canceling a subscription.
It prevents memory leaks by allowing you to clean up resources when they are no longer needed.
Operators:

# Combine provides a set of powerful operators to manipulate and transform values in a Publisher's stream.
Examples include map, filter, merge, flatMap, etc.
Operators allow you to create a chain of transformations in a readable and functional way.
Subject:

# A Subject is both a Publisher and a Subscriber.
It can be used to inject values into a Combine pipeline.
Examples include PassthroughSubject and CurrentValueSubject.
Schedulers:

# Combine introduces the concept of schedulers for managing the execution context.
Schedulers control where and when various parts of a Combine pipeline execute.
Common schedulers include DispatchQueue.main, RunLoop, and ImmediateScheduler.
Error Handling:

# Combine handles errors through the tryMap operator, which allows throwing errors.
The replaceError(with:) operator provides a way to replace errors with a default value.
catch and retry operators are available for more advanced error handling.
Binding:

Combine simplifies the binding of UI elements to data.
The bind method allows you to bind a Publisher to a property of a SwiftUI view, automatically updating the UI when the Publisher emits new values.
Debugging:

Combine includes operators like print for debugging and understanding the flow of values through the Combine pipeline.
Breakpoints can be set on operators to pause execution for debugging.
